# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
# Backend must have CONTRACT_ADDRESS and CHAIN_ID in its .env

# Option B: Set config directly (if not using backend)
# Deployed Counter contract address (from contracts/scripts/deploy.js)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
# Chain ID for local Hardhat node (31337)
